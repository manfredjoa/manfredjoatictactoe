I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.

In the rare case that you do not know how to play tic-tac-toe, the objective is to get three in a row. All you have to do is alternate between two players, clicking on a square that you would like to claim. Red goes first, followed by blue, with the game ending in three results: red wins, blue wins, or tie. There is also a scoreboard on the sides of the screen to keep track of who's winning. To reset the board during the game, you can click the reset bottom on the bottom of the screen. To play a new game after a result has been determined, click the play again button.

Have fun!
